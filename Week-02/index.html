                <p>
                    Megarocket SA gym was founded in 1995 by a former Olympic athlete named Max Strong. Max had always been
                    passionate about fitness and wanted to create a gym that would provide people with a welcoming and
                    inclusive environment to pursue their fitness goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, Megarocket SA grew into one of the most popular gyms in the city, with a thriving 
                    community of members who were passionate about fitness. Max continued to run the gym until he retired 
                    in 2020.
